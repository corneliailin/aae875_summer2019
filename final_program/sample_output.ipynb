    "Hi, I'm Freddie, what is your name?\n",
    ">: C. Ilin\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice to meet you Cornelia. How can I help you today?\n",
    ">: I would like to analyze some hospital discharge data (really big!), can you help me with this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, I can help you with this. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is your computer's operating system? \n",
    ">: Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice. Your drive letter is now set to N:\\ \n",
    "\n",
    "What is your input path?\n",
    ">: Classes, AAE875, DataAnalytics, FinalProgram, Input\n",

    "What is the data structure you would like to work with?\n",
    ">: list(csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, good choice. Tell me what you would like to do next?\n",
    ">: How many columns and row are in my data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me check... oh... this data is really big, C. Ilin!\n",
    "You have **X million** inpatient discharges and **Y variables** that document these observations.\n",
    ">: Ok, sounds a bit intimidating but let's move on.\n",
    ">: My final objective is to run a linear regression but I would like to clean the data and run some statistics first.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "No problem, I can help you with this. Let's clean the data first.\n",
    "Would you like to drop observations with missing values?\n",
    ">: Yes, please.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have removed all the missing values in your data. \n",
    "You now have **X million** inpatient discharges and **Y variables** that document these observations.\n",
    ">: Still lots of data to play with, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Right... would you like to remove data outliers?\n",
    ">: Yes, let's do this as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have removed all outliers in your data. \n",
    "You now have **X million** inpatient discharges and **Y variables** that document these observations.\n",
    ">: Got it, thanks - you are really good at this!\n",
    ">: Freddie, let's run some summary statistics now.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am affraid this is not the best way to move forward. The variable names in your data are not consistent over time. \n",
    "Let me put these in a table for you. Please see below:\n",
    "[Print table here]\n",
    ">: I see... variable names are not consistent over time, good catch. Could you please change the names for years 2014, 2015 to allign with those in year 2016?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure thing! I will use a dictionary for this. Processing...\n",
    "Variable names match those in year 2016 now. Please see below:\n",
    "[Print table here]\n",
    ">: Great! Are we ready to move to the descripte statistics part?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, unless you want to do more data cleaning?\n",
    ">: Let's keep going, we may see more inconsistencies when we plot statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure thing! I can plot some graphs for you. What do you want to know more precisely?\n",
    ">: I would like to see how many patients with asthma conditions where admitted in the hospital by year and type of admission\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very interesting question, C. Ilin. Let me prepare some graphs for you...\n",
    "Here is what I found:\n",
    "[Plot graphs here]\n",
    ">: Hmm, that's very interesting. [Comment more on the results here]\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, very interesting. Would you like me to plot some more graphs?\n",
    ">: Yes, please. Let's see what is the major payor for patients with asthma conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that there are 10 types of payment sources. I think a pie chart is more appropriate here. Do you agree?\n",
    ">: Yes, let's plot a pie chart\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting results again. Please see below what I found in the data:\n",
    "[Plot graphs here]\n",
    ">: This is really cool stuff, Freddie!\n",
    "\n",
    "C.Ilin - I agree with you. In the meanwhile I need a break. I will be back in 15 minutes.\n",
    ">: Enjoy!\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, I am back. You mentioned your main objective is to fit a linear regression model. I am ready whenever you are ready. \n",
    ">: Let's do it, Freddie. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is your question? \n",
    ">: I would like to see if there is any casual effect between hospital length of stay for patients with asthma conditions and health insurance status. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds like a very interesting question. What would be the control variables then?\n",
    ">: Let's try these: gender, race, type of admission, patient disposition, health service area, facility, year\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, I will put all these in an OLS model. \n",
    "Here are the results:\n",
    "[Print regression analysis results]\n",
    ">: Freddie, this is fantastic! Thanks much for your help!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, any time.\n",
    "Goodbye C.Ilin\n",
    ">: Goodbye Freddie\n"
